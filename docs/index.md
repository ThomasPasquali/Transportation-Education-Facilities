# KGE 2023 - Trentino Transportation and Education Facilities

### KGE project - Transportation & Education Facilities

This project was developed in the academic year 2023/24 for the course Knowledge Graph Engineering. 
In this page there will be the description of the work done by our team, Pasquali Thomas, and Peiretti Riccardo. Furthermore, there will be links to all the resources used for this project. 

#### Project purpose 
The goal of this project is to build a Knowledge Graph (KG) which satisfies the many different need of students, professors, and educational staff to reach their middle/high-school and university by public transportation within the region of Trentino or from the main Italian cities, depending on the specific person engagements, domicile, and residence. This KG purpose is to provide data to a web/smartphone application (e.g. UniTrentoApp) for, given the user weekly educational schedule, easily and conveniently gathering information about public transportation in order to organize the most convenient trips. This purpose includes, both out-of-door and Trentino’s students, teachers that rarely have to reach Trentino and commuters. 

#### Domain of interest
The DoI of this project consists of two boundaries: space and time. This KGE project considers the public transportation of the region of Trentino (Italy) and main Italian cities together with Trentino education facilities over a period of time of approximately nine months between September 2023 and June 2024. 

#### ER-model
Considering the Domain of Interest, and the scenario created by our team, the following steps have been followed: 
1. entities identification;
2. attributes identification;
3. relationships identifiaction.

The ER-model gives an idea of the three main components of the KG: 
- EndUser 
- Education 
- Transportation
- Common 

The ER-model, at the beginning is composed by certain entities, but during the work, we refine the languge (concepts and words) employed for representing the information needed to fulfill the project purpose. The concepts were identified or created using the kge-annotator. For each (until now) used word/term, the tool was employed to identify the most appropriate concept by searching for synonyms or similar terms. If a sufficiently precise concept already existed in the UKC, it was adopted as is. However, in cases where concepts were either too general or completely absent, they were created as new. More details about this phase are reported in the report Phae 6 Language Definition. Below there is the final ER-model.

#### Information gathering 
This section aims at reporting the execution of the activities involved in the Information Gathering iTelos phase. In the table below there is an explanation of where are taken the data.

#### Knowledge definition  
The Knowledge definition is dedicated to the description of the kTelos phase. Starting from the collected project resources, the formalized purpose (partly expressed by the ER model) and the collected data, the goal is to produce the final KG’s teleontology. In particular, the knowledge resources produced in this phase aims at unifying the representation of the information, improving the interoperability and reusability of the final KG(s). By building knowledge resources reusing as much as possible well-known standard domain ontologies and data schema. As reported in the table below, there is an explanation of the used ontologies. However, it was necessary also to create an ontology refers to the part of the End-user, made by our team.
